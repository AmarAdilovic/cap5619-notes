    "## Introduction\n",
    "- Concurrent Neural Networks (CNNs) have been very successful in practical applications.\n",
    "- The \"convolution\" in the name signifies that it employs a mathematical operation called a \"convolution\". A convolution is a specialized linear operation.\n",
    "- CNNs are just neural networks that use convolution instead of general matrix multiplication in at least ONE layer\n",

    "- Convolution is an operation on two functions of a real-valued argument\n",
    "    - Example\n",
    "        - Assume you are tracking a car with a sensor, the sensor provides a single output, *x(t)*, the position of the car at time *t*.\n",
    "            - BOTH *x* and *t* are **real-valued**, we can get a different reading from the senor at any time\n",
    "            - What do we do if the sensor is noisy?\n",
    "                - We can average several measurements, more recent measurements are more relevant, so we want a weighted average that gives *more* weight to recent measurements\n",
